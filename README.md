# AI Chatbot Interface in JavaScript

## Project Overview

This project is a simple web-based chat interface that demonstrates how to integrate a basic AI interaction into a website using JavaScript. It includes two modes: an API mode that simulates calls to an AI service and a random response mode for quick testing and prototyping.  The interface also includes a light/dark mode toggle for enhanced user experience.

## Key Components

*   **`index.html`**:  The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the chat interface, including the input field, chat display area, mode selector, and theme toggle button.
*   **`style.css`**:  The CSS file that styles the chat interface, providing a visually appealing layout and handling the light/dark mode switch.
*   **`script.js`**:  The JavaScript file that contains the logic for handling user input, simulating AI responses, and toggling between light and dark modes.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I learned:

*   How to create a dynamic web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   How to handle user input and update the DOM (Document Object Model) in real-time.
*   How to simulate asynchronous API calls using `async/await` and Promises.
*   How to implement a basic light/dark mode toggle using CSS classes and JavaScript.

## Use Cases

This project can be used as a starting point for:

*   Building a more complex chatbot interface.
*   Integrating AI services into web applications.
*   Creating interactive tutorials or demos.
*   Experimenting with different UI/UX designs for chat interfaces.
