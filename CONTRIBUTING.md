## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold the usual code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to [pertu.works@gmail.com](mailto:pertu.works@gmail.com).

## Getting Started

### Issues

- **Bug Reports**: Use the bug report template to provide detailed information about the issue.
- **Feature Requests**: Use the feature request template to suggest new functionality.
- **Questions**: For general questions, please use the discussions tab instead of issues.

Before submitting a new issue:

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. If you find a related issue, add your information as a comment
3. Only create a new issue if necessary

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork of the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GigabyteBlender/AI-Chatbot-Template.git
   ```

2. Add the original repository as upstream
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/GigabyteBlender/AI-Chatbot-Template.git
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Create your environment file
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with necessary values
   ```

5. Start development server
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

### JavaScript/React Style Guide

We follow a modified version of the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide:

- Use functional components with hooks rather than class components
- Use named exports instead of default exports where possible
- Organize imports in the following order:
  1. React and React-related libraries
  2. Third-party libraries
  3. Project components
  4. Utilities, hooks, and contexts
  5. Assets and styles

Example component structure:
```jsx
// External libraries
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// Project components
import Button from '../Shared/Button';

// Hooks and utilities
import { useAuth } from '../../hooks/useAuth';
import { formatDate } from '../../utils/formatters';

// Styles
import './ComponentName.css';

const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // State, effects, and logic
  
  // Component functions
  
  // Render
  return (
    <div className="component-name">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};

ComponentName.propTypes = {
  prop1: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  prop2: PropTypes.number,
};

ComponentName.defaultProps = {
  prop2: 0,
};

export default ComponentName;
```

### CSS Guidelines

- Use semantic class names following BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology
- Keep specificity low when possible
- Use variables for colors, spacing, and other reusable values

### Commit Messages

We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add Google sign-in option
fix(chat): resolve message duplication issue
docs: update API integration instructions
```

## Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Run tests before submitting a pull request
- Aim for good test coverage

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm test -- --watch
```

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Document new features with examples
- Comment complex code sections
- Update JSDoc comments for functions and components

## Review Process

1. I will review your PR
2. I might ask for changes or clarification
3. Once approved, it will merge your PR
4. Your contribution will be part of the next release
